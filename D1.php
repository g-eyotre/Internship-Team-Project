                          <p style="margin-left: 15px;">Diaper rash, or diaper dermatitis, is the term used to describe an irritating condition that develops on the skin that is covered by a diaper. It is one of the most common skin problems in infants and children, affecting between 7 and 35 percent of infants at some point. Diaper rash occurs most commonly in infants between ages 9 and 12 months but can occur at any time the child wears a diaper.

Fortunately, most cases of diaper rash are short-lived and resolve with home treatment. This topic review discusses the most common causes, treatment recommendations, and strategies to prevent diaper rash. <div class="row">

                <p style="margin-left: 15px;">Diaper-related rash — Diaper-related rashes can be caused by irritation, a yeast infection, or an allergic reaction. Diaper-related rashes may occur more frequently if a child has an episode of diarrhea or has recently taken antibiotics.

                <ul>
  <li>Irritant dermatitis — Irritant dermatitis is the medical term for red and inflamed skin that is caused by any irritant </li>
  <li>Yeast infection — Yeast (Candida) infections can develop if irritant dermatitis is not treated for more than a few days. Signs of yeast diaper dermatitis include dark red areas of skin with or without raised yellow, fluid-filled pustules that can rupture and flake. Yeast infections are often found in the skin folds between the thigh and body, and in the folds of skin around the genitals.</li>
  <li>Allergic reaction — Allergic reactions or skin sensitivity to the diaper itself is a less common cause of diaper rash. Signs of allergic contact dermatitis include itchy red, raised, scaly skin in the diaper area. Areas of skin that are in contact with dyes on the diaper can become sensitive and develop an allergic reaction. Some baby wipes may contain preservatives that can also cause an allergic reaction.</li>
