                          <p style="margin-left: 15px;">There may be some truth to Mary Poppins’ famous song. Recent studies have shown that a “spoonful of sugar” might do more than make medicine taste better. Sugar water might also have some pain-relieving properties for babies.</p>

                <h2 class="text-primary text-center">Why is sugar water used for babies?</h2>
                <p style="margin-left: 15px;">Sugar water is something that medical facilities and providers may use during a painful procedure on a young child to help with pain relief, but it’s not recommended for daily use at your home,” says Dr. Shana Godfred-Cato, a pediatrician at Austin Regional Clinic.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 15px;">Some hospitals use sugar water to help babies with pain during a circumcision or other surgeries. At the pediatrician’s office, sugar water could be given to reduce pain when the baby is being given a shot, a foot prick, or having blood drawn.</p>

                <h2 class="text-primary text-center">How is sugar water given to babies?</h2>

                <p style="margin-left: 15px;">Sugar water should be administered by a pediatrician. They may administer it to your baby either by syringe into the infant’s mouth or by placing it on a pacifier.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 15px;">The mixture can be prepared at the doctor’s office or hospital, or it may come ready-made like a medication.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 15px;">The amount given per procedure is approximately 1 milliliter and contains a 24 percent sugar solution,” says Dr. Danelle Fisher, chair of pediatrics at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, California.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 15px;">“There is no standard recipe that has been studied, and I don’t recommend making it on your own,” says Dr. Godfred-Cato.</p>

            <h2 class="text-primary text-center">What are the risks of giving sugar water to your baby?</h2>
            <ul>
  <li>“If the mixture isn’t appropriate and the child gets too much pure water, it can cause electrolyte disturbances that may lead to seizures in severe cases,” says Dr. Fisher.</li>
  <li>When the body gets too much water, it dilutes the amount of sodium, putting electrolytes off balance. This causes tissue to swell and can cause a seizure, or even put your child into a coma.</li>
  <li>If given incorrectly, sugar water can have some potentially serious side effects. For this reason, it’s recommended that you use the treatment under a pediatrician’s supervision.</li> 
  <li>Other potential side effects include upset stomach, spitting up, and decreased appetite for breast milk or formula.</li>
  <li>“Too much sugar water may affect the baby’s appetite for breast milk or formula, and a [newborn baby] should only take a fluid with nutrients and protein, not purely a liquid made of water and sugar,” says Dr. Fisher.</li>
