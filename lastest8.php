                <p style="margin-left: 15px;">Once your twins are sleeping through the night, it may be tempting to put them in separate rooms so they won’t wake each other. But that will only teach them to rely on total silence to stay asleep. “Let the babies sleep in the same room to get used to each other’s crying,” says Alesandra Dubin, a Los Angeles mom of boy-girl twins.</p>

                <h2 class="text-primary text-center">Put the twins on the same schedule</h2>
                <p style="margin-left: 15px;">One of the best ways to streamline your day is to put both twins on the same schedule. If one baby wakes up hungry, feed both of them, even if it means waking a sleeping baby. Put them down for a nap at the same time, and bathe them one right after the other. </p>

                <p style="margin-left: 15px;">Set up the pajamas, diapers, vitamins, nose suctions, or other gear you might need. Prepare the bottles or set your breastfeeding station with the nursing pillow. Planning ahead is key with bathing, especially since it’s one of the tasks that need both your hands to do. </p>

            <h2 class="text-primary text-center"> Feed at the same time</h2>
            <p style="margin-left: 15px;">If you’re new to swaddling, you may be wondering where to start. Here are some tips on how to swaddle your baby safely. And always reach out to your pediatrician if you need further guidance.</p>
            <ul>
  <li>Most people assume it’s impossible or have never even heard of tandem feeding. With long feeding sessions and short wake times, tandem feeding can save you so much time.</li>
  <li>Get a nursing pillow catered to twins. You can place both twins on the pillow and keep your hands free. Start with the baby with the more difficult latch. If one finishes before the other, burp him by either holding him up to your shoulder or keeping him on the pillow at an incline.</li>
  <li>Practice makes perfect. For the longest time, I wasn’t able to burp the twins on my own and would have to hand one to someone else.</li> 
  <li>Feeding twins with bottles can be done in tandem as well. Once your twins have control over their necks, place them in bouncers so you can hold both bottles.</li>

            <h2 class="text-primary text-center">Accept help during the early weeks</h2>
            <ul>
  <li>Asking for help is common even with singleton babies, but much more necessary with twins. If someone can spend a few weeks at your home, even better. They can help soothe and care for the twins or tend to your older kids.</li>
  <li>They can also help prepare meals, wash dishes, or throw out the trash. Even weekend helpers can bring meals, buy groceries, or play with the twins while you catch a break.</li>
  <li>Caring for twins means leaning on your village, especially in the first few months. You might feel outnumbered during those challenging moments, so ask or even hire help</li>
