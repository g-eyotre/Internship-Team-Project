            <h2 class="text-primary text-center">How Much Will Baby Sleep?</h2>
            <ul>
  <li>Your baby's internal clock has kicked in, and they can differentiate between day and night. They should be on their way toward an established sleep pattern.</li>
  <li>During this time, babies need an average of 14 hours of sleep daily. At 4 months, they can go eight hours at night without feeding; by 5 months, they can sleep for 10 or 11 hours straight.</li>
  <li>Both 4-month-olds and 5-month-olds will sleep four to five hours during the day, spread out over two to three naps. At 6 months, babies get an average of 11 hours of uninterrupted sleep each night, and three to four hours of daytime naps spread over two to three naps.</li> 
  <li>At 6 months, babies need an average of 11 hours of uninterrupted sleep each night, and 3.5 hours of daytime naps spread over two to three naps.</li>

            <h2 class="text-primary text-center">Stay Consistent</h2>
            <ul>
  <li>Children crave routine, so it's important to establish a consistent 4-month-old, 5-month-old, and 6-month-old sleep schedule. "Once that internal clock kicks in, you'll notice the baby has a preference for when he wants to go to sleep," says Nadav Traeger, M.D, director of pediatric sleep medicine at Maria Fareri Children's Hospital at Westchester Medical Center. And you know that "witching hour" that so many new moms talk about? It usually occurs in the evenings, and the primary reason is tiredness. So if your baby gets fussy around 6 p.m., start getting them ready for bed at 5:30 so that they're already dozing off before the crankiness begins.</li>

            <h2 class="text-primary text-center">Recognizing Sleep Signals</h2>
            <ul>
  <li>Your baby will send some pretty clear signs that they're ready for sleep. "I often tell parents to become sensitive to their child's personal sleep signals," says Marc Weissbluth, M.D, a pediatrician and author of Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child. "This means that you should capture that magic moment when the child is tired, ready to sleep, and easily falls asleep. The magic moment is a slight quieting, a slight staring off, and a hint of calmness." Other signals include yawning, rubbing their eyes, and losing interest in other people or toys. The key is putting Baby to bed before they start crying, fussing, or throwing tantrums.</li>

            <h2 class="text-primary text-center">Start Sleep Training</h2>
            <ul>
  <li>Most people wake up several times each night. While adults simply roll over and go back to sleep, some babies expect you to help them doze off again. But it's important that your baby learns to self-soothe thoughâ€”and sleep training methods can help with that. Feel free to choose whichever method you'd like, from the cry-it-out method to the Ferber method to the fading method (learn about the different options here). "Think about your baby's temperament and what she can handle," Dr. Traeger says. Still not sure? Consult your pediatrician, who has heard feedback from patients, and might even have experience with their own kids!</li>

            <h2 class="text-primary text-center">Eliminate Nighttime Feedings</h2>
            <ul>
  <li>If you haven't already, start cutting middle-of-the-night feedings out of your baby sleep schedule "You want to really focus on meeting the baby's nutritional needs during the day so he doesn't eat at night," West says. "He should be either sleeping through the night or eating only once at night." To accomplish this goal, West recommends more frequent feedings in the late afternoon or early evening.</li>
