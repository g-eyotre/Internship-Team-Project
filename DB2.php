                <p style="margin-left: 15px;">Wiping</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 15px;">Using the wet washcloth, cotton balls, or baby wipes, gently wipe your baby clean from the front to the back (never wipe from back to front, especially on girls, or you could spread bacteria that can cause urinary tract infections). You might want to lift your baby's legs by the ankles to get underneath. Don't forget the creases in the thighs and buttocks.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 15px;">Keep your baby as covered as possible since exposure to air often causes babies to pee — on you, the walls, or anything else within range.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 15px;">Once you've finished wiping, pat your baby dry with a clean washcloth and apply diaper ointment.</p>

                <h2 class="text-primary text-center">Disposable Diapers</h2>
                <ul>
  <li>Open the diaper and slide it under your baby while gently lifting your little one's legs and feet. The back part with the adhesive strips should be about level with your baby's bellybutton.</li>
  <li>Bring the front part of the diaper up between your baby's legs and onto their belly.</li>
  <li>Bring the adhesive strips around and fasten snugly. Be careful not to stick the tape onto your baby's skin.</li> 
  <li>Empty the garbage regularly (about once a day) if you're using disposables. This prevents a stinky diaper pail.</li>
  <li>If you find any marks around your baby's legs and waist, the diaper is too tight. Go for a looser fit next time. If that doesn’t help, your baby may be ready for the next size diaper.</li>

                <h2 class="text-primary text-center">Cloth Diapers</h2>
                <p style="margin-left: 15px;">If you're using traditional cloth diapers, there are several ways to fasten them. One of the more commonly used ways is the triangular fold:</p>
                <ul>
  <li>Fold the square in half to form a triangle. (For newborns or smaller babies, you might need to fold the long side of the triangle down a few inches so it fits your baby better.)</li>
  <li>Bring one side around so it overlaps the center part.</li>
  <li>Bring the other side around so it overlaps the other two parts. Fasten all three parts together with a safety pin.</li>
  <li>If using diapers that require pinning, use oversize pins with plastic safety heads. To prevent pricking the baby, keep your hand between the pin and your little one's skin. Or, use diaper tape that comes in a dispenser.</li>
  <li>Always wash your hands well after changing your baby's diaper to prevent the spread of germs.</li>
