                <p style="margin-left: 15px;">It is possible to reduce the risk of developing diaper rash by following some basic hygiene suggestions:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>It is not clear whether cloth or disposable diapers are superior in preventing diaper rash. With either choice, changing the diaper frequently can reduce contact between the skin and urine or feces.

</li>
  <li>If cloth diapers are used, avoid using plastic pants to cover the diaper. Cloth diapers should be washed in hot water with bleach.</li>
  <li>Clean the skin in the diaper area gently and carefully. Overzealous cleansing can cause or worsen irritation and delay skin healing. Gentle cleansing with warm water and a soft cloth is usually sufficient. If soap is desired, a mild, fragrance-free product is recommended.</li>
  <li>Suddenly more or less frequent stools</li>
  <li>If baby wipes are used, choose a brand that is alcohol and fragrance-free. Baby wipes are not recommended if the skin becomes irritated or develops open sores. If a diaper rash does not seem to be improving, baby wipes should potentially be stopped, as some baby wipes can cause allergic skin reactions.
</li>
